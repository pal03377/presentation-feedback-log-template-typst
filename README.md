# Presentation feedback log template
During a BA/MA/GR presentation at the group for Applied Software Engineering you will receive feedback from your advisor and supervisor. 
A fellow student will note down the feedback and will send it to the professor, your advisor, and you. 
After you hand in your thesis, you have to summarize the feedback you got, and how you implemented it. 
This template provides an example layout for the feedback log. 


## Usage
1. Adapt the document metadata (Marked with `#FIXME` in the document)
2. Summarize each feedback item in 2-3 sentences and put it in a `#feedback[...]` function call
3. Add your response to the feedback in a `#response[...]` function after each feedback item
